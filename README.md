## Synopsis

The Airbnb clone project for which we are creating a copy of the Airbnb. This is the first step towards building our
first full web application.In this clone, only some features will be implemented and will be
listed below once completed.

## How to use the console?
Have you ever worked with the unix shell before? If yes, then that's exactly how this console works
It works both in interactive and non-interactive mode, the prompt **(hbnb)** is first display and 
wait for the user for input.
